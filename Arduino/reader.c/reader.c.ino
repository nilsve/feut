/*
 * This sketch uses the MFRC522 Library to use ARDUINO RFID MODULE KIT 13.56 MHZ WITH TAGS SPI W AND R BY COOQROBOT.
 * The library file MFRC522.h has a wealth of useful info. Please read it.
 * The functions are documented in MFRC522.cpp.
 *
 * Based on code Dr.Leong   ( WWW.B2CQSHOP.COM )
 * Created by Miguel Balboa (circuitito.com), Jan, 2012.
 * Rewritten by SÃ¸ren Thing Andersen (access.thing.dk), fall of 2013 (Translation to English, refactored, comments, anti collision, cascade levels.)
 * 
 * This library has been released into the public domain.
